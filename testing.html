                <p>(she/her)
                    I am a recent graduate of the Masters in Counselling Psychology program at the University of Victoria.
                    Throughout my work, I have gained experience working with adolescents and their parents, individual adults, and in support groups as a co-facilitator for LGBTQ+ identifying folks. 
                    I have also worked with and supported individuals who experience ADHD, anxiety and depression 
                    I am dedicated to providing my clients with a safe, compassionate, validating and non-judgmental space that facilitates healing and fulfillment. 
                    My goal is to continually support you and work with you to address the various concerns and challenges that may occur within your life. I am committed to helping guide you through a therapeutic process that is collaborative, supportive, goal-oriented, and feels meaningful to you. 
                    Through the counselling relationship, I am dedicated to helping clients develop themselves in core areas such as self-awareness, acceptance, coping strategies and communicational skills.
                    My particular areas of interest include self-esteem development, anxiety, ADHD, stress, social and emotional wellness, relationship and interpersonal issues, LGBTQ2S+ issues, gender identity, and adolescent behavioural challenges.
                    I utilize an integrative counselling approach rooted primarily in person-centered, cognitive behavioural, strengths-based and solution-focused techniques, and believe in the power of one’s own strengths and resilience to create positive change. 
                    Together, we can develop strategies that “fit,” are effective, and reinforce positive patterns that support you in moving towards wellness.</p>
